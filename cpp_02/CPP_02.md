Chapter I
Intro duction
C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an ex-
tension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes" (source:
 Wikipedia
).
The goal of these mo dules is to intro duce you to
Ob ject-Oriented Programming
.
This will b e the starting p oint of your C++ journey. Many languages are recommended
to learn OOP. We decided to cho ose C++ since it's derived from your old friend C.
Because this is a complex language, and in order to keep things simple, your co de will
comply with the C++98 standard.
We are aware mo dern C++ is way diÀôerent in a lot of asp ects. So if you want to
b ecome a proÀùcient C++ develop er, it's up to you to go further after the 42 Common
Core!

Chapter I I
General rules
Compiling

Compile your co de with
c++
and the Àõags
-Wall -Wextra -Werror

Your co de should still compile if you add the Àõag
-std=c++98
Formatting and naming conventions

The exercise directories will b e named this way:
ex00, ex01, ... , exn

Name your Àùles, classes, functions, memb er functions and attributes as required in
the guidelines.

Write class names in
Upp erCamelCase
format. Files containing clas s co de will
always b e named according to the class name. For instance:
ClassName.hpp
/
ClassName.h
,
ClassName.cpp
, or
ClassName.tpp
. Then, if you
have a header Àùle containing the deÀùnition of a class "BrickWall" standing for a
brick wall, its name will b e
BrickWall.hpp
.

Unless sp eciÀùed otherwise, every output messages must b e ended by a new-line
character and displayed to the standard output.

Goodbye Norminette!
No co ding style is enforced in the C++ mo dules. You can
follow your favorite one. But keep in mind that a co de your p eer-evaluators can't
understand is a co de they can't grade. Do your b est to write a clean and readable
co de.
Allowe d/Forbidden
You are not co ding in C anymore. Time to C++! Therefore:

You are allowed to use almost everything from the standard library. Thus, instead
of sticking to what you already know, it would b e smart to use as much as p ossible
the C++-ish versions of the C functions you are used to.

However, you can't use any other external library. It means C++11 (and derived
forms) and
Boost
libraries are forbidden. The following functions are forbidden
to o:
*printf()
,
*alloc()
and
free()
. If you use them, your grade will b e 0 and
that's it.

C++ - Mo dule 02
Ad-ho c p olymorphism, op erator overloading
and Ortho dox Canonical class form

Note that unless explicitly stated otherwise, the
using namespace <ns_name>
and
friend
keywords are forbidden. Otherwise, your grade will b e -42.

You are allowed to use the STL in the Mo dule 08 and 09 only.
That means:
no
Containers
(vector/list/map/and so forth) and no
Algorithms
(anything that
requires to include the
<algorithm>
header) until then. Otherwise, your grade will
b e -42.
A few design requirements

Memory leakage o ccurs in C++ to o. When you allo cate memory (by using the
new
keyword), you must avoid
memory leaks
.

From Mo dule 02 to Mo dule 09, your classes must b e designed in the
Ortho dox
Canonical Form, except when explicitely stated othe rwise
.

Any function implementation put in a header Àùle (except for function templates)
means 0 to the exercise.

You should b e able to use each of your headers indep endently from others. Thus,
they must include all the dep endencies they need. However, you must avoid the
problem of double inclusion by adding
include guards
. Otherwise, your grade will
b e 0.
Read me

You can add some additional Àùles if you need to (i.e., to split your co de). As these
assignments are not veriÀùed by a program, feel free to do so as long as you turn in
the mandatory Àùles.

Sometimes, the guidelines of an exercise lo ok short but the examples can show
requirements that are not explicitly written in the instructions.

Read each mo dule completely b efore starting! Really, do it.

By Odin, by Thor! Use your brain!!!
You will have to implement a lot of classes. This can seem tedious,
unless you're able to script your favorite text editor.
You are given a certain amount of freedom to complete the exercises.
However, follow the mandatory rules and don't be lazy. You would
miss a lot of useful information! Do not hesitate to read about
theoretical concepts.

Chapter I I I
New rules
From now on, all your classes must b e designed in the
Ortho dox Canonical Form
,
unless explicitely stated otherwise. Then, they will implement the four required memb er
functions b elow:

Default constructor

Copy constructor

Copy assignment op erator

Destructor
Split your class co de into two Àùles. The header Àùle (.hpp/.h) contains the class
deÀùnition whereas the source Àùle (.cpp) contains the implementation.

You think you know integers and Àõoating-p oint numb ers. How cute.
Please read this 3 pages article (
1
,
 2
,
 3
) to discover that you don't. Go on, read it.
Until to day, every numb er you used in your co de was basically either an integer or a
Àõoating-p oint numb er, or any of their variants (
short
,
char
,
long
,
double
, and so forth).
After reading the article ab ove, it's safe to assume that integers and Àõoating-p oint num-
b ers have opp osite caracteristics.
But to day, things will change. You are going to discover a new and awesome numb er
typ e:
Àùxed-p oint numb ers
! Forever missing from the scalar typ es of most languages,
Àùxed-p oint numb ers oÀôer a valuable balance b etween p erformance, accuracy, range and
precision. That explains why Àùxed-p oint numb ers are particularly applicable to computer
graphics, sound pro cessing or scientiÀùc programming, just to name a few.
As C++ lacks Àùxed-p oint numb ers, you're going to add them.
 This article
 from
Berkeley is a go o d start. If you have no idea what Berkeley University is, read

and Ortho dox Canonical class form
Create a class in Ortho dox Canonical Form that represents a Àùxed-p oint numb er:

Private memb ers:

An
integer
to store the Àùxed-p oint numb er value.

A
static constant integer
to store the numb er of fractional bits. Its value
will always b e the integer literal
8
.

Public memb ers:

A default constructor that initializes the Àùxed-p oint numb er value to
0
.

A copy constructor.

A copy ass ignment op erator overload.

A destructor.

A memb er function
int getRawBits( void ) const;
that returns the raw value of the Àùxed-p oint value.

A memb er function
void setRawBits( int const raw );
that sets the raw value of the Àùxed-p oint numb er.

The previous exercise was a go o d start but our class is pretty useles s. It can only
represent the value
0.0
.
Add the following public constructors and public memb er functions to your class:

A constructor that takes a
constant integer
as a parameter.
It converts it to the corresp onding Àùxed-p oint value. The fractional bits value is
initialized to 8 like in exercise 00.

A constructor that takes a
constant Àõoating-p oint numb e r
as a parameter.
It converts it to the corresp onding Àùxed-p oint value. The fractional bits value is
initialized to 8 like in exercise 00.

A memb er function
float toFloat( void ) const;
that converts the Àùxed-p oint value to a Àõoating-p oint value.

A memb er function
int toInt( void ) const;
that converts the Àùxed-p oint value to an integer value.
And add the following function to the
Fixed
class Àùles:

An overload of the insertion () op erator that inserts a Àõoating-p oint representation
of the Àùxed-p oint numb er into the output stream ob ject passed as parameter.

Now that you have a functional

class, it would b e nice to use it.
Implement a function which indicates whether a p oint is inside of a triangle or not.
Very useful, isn't it?
BSP stands for Binary space partitioning. You are welcome. :)
You can pass this module without doing exercise 03.

C++ - Mo dule 02
Ad-ho c p olymorphism, op erator overloading
and Ortho dox Canonical class form
Let's start by creating the class
Point
in Ortho dox Canonical Form that represents
a 2D p oint:

Private memb ers:

A Fixed const attribute
x
.

A Fixed const attribute
y
.

Anything else useful.

Public memb ers:

A default constructor that initializes
x
and
y
to
0
.

A constructor that takes as parameters two constant Àõoating-p oint numb ers.
It initializes
x
and
y
with those parameters.

A copy constructor.

A copy ass ignment op erator overload.

A destructor.

Anything else useful.
To conclude, implement the following function in the appropriate Àùle:
bool bsp( Point const a, Point const b, Point const c, Point const point);

a, b, c: The vertices of our b eloved triangle.

p oint: The p oint to check.

Returns: True if the p oint is inside the triangle. False otherwise.
Thus, if the p oint is a vertex or on edge, it will return False.
Implement and turn in your own tests to ensure that your class b ehaves as exp ected.
