Chapter I
Intro duction
C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an ex-
tension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes" (source:
 Wikipedia
).
The goal of these mo dules is to intro duce you to
Ob ject-Oriented Programming
.
This will b e the starting p oint of your C++ journey. Many languages are recommended
to learn OOP. We decided to cho ose C++ since it's derived from your old friend C.
Because this is a complex language, and in order to keep things simple, your co de will
comply with the C++98 standard.
We are aware mo dern C++ is way diÀôerent in a lot of asp ects. So if you want to
b ecome a proÀùcient C++ develop er, it's up to you to go further after the 42 Common
Core!

Chapter I I
General rules
Compiling

Compile your co de with
c++
and the Àõags
-Wall -Wextra -Werror

Your co de should still compile if you add the Àõag
-std=c++98
Formatting and naming conventions

The exercise directories will b e named this way:
ex00, ex01, ... , exn

Name your Àùles, classes, functions, memb er functions and attributes as required in
the guidelines.

Write class names in
Upp erCamelCase
format. Files containing clas s co de will
always b e named according to the class name. For instance:
ClassName.hpp
/
ClassName.h
,
ClassName.cpp
, or
ClassName.tpp
. Then, if you
have a header Àùle containing the deÀùnition of a class "BrickWall" standing for a
brick wall, its name will b e
BrickWall.hpp
.

Unless sp eciÀùed otherwise, every output messages must b e ended by a new-line
character and displayed to the standard output.

Goodbye Norminette!
No co ding style is enforced in the C++ mo dules. You can
follow your favorite one. But keep in mind that a co de your p eer-evaluators can't
understand is a co de they can't grade. Do your b est to write a clean and readable
co de.
Allowe d/Forbidden
You are not co ding in C anymore. Time to C++! Therefore:

You are allowed to use almost everything from the standard library. Thus, instead
of sticking to what you already know, it would b e smart to use as much as p ossible
the C++-ish versions of the C functions you are used to.

However, you can't use any other external library. It means C++11 (and derived
forms) and
Boost
libraries are forbidden. The following functions are forbidden
to o:
*printf()
,
*alloc()
and
free()
. If you use them, your grade will b e 0 and
that's it.

C++ - Mo dule 09 STL

Note that unless explicitly stated otherwise, the
using namespace <ns_name>
and
friend
keywords are forbidden. Otherwise, your grade will b e -42.

You are allowed to use the STL in the Mo dule 08 and 09 only.
That means:
no
Containers
(vector/list/map/and so forth) and no
Algorithms
(anything that
requires to include the
<algorithm>
header) until then. Otherwise, your grade will
b e -42.
A few design requirements

Memory leakage o ccurs in C++ to o. When you allo cate memory (by using the
new
keyword), you must avoid
memory leaks
.

From Mo dule 02 to Mo dule 09, your classes must b e designed in the
Ortho dox
Canonical Form, except when explicitely stated othe rwise
.

Any function implementation put in a header Àùle (except for function templates)
means 0 to the exercise.

You should b e able to use each of your headers indep endently from others. Thus,
they must include all the dep endencies they need. However, you must avoid the
problem of double inclusion by adding
include guards
. Otherwise, your grade will
b e 0.
Read me

You can add some additional Àùles if you need to (i.e., to split your co de). As these
assignments are not veriÀùed by a program, feel free to do so as long as you turn in
the mandatory Àùles.

Sometimes, the guidelines of an exercise lo ok short but the examples can show
requirements that are not explicitly written in the instructions.

Read each mo dule completely b efore starting! Really, do it.

By Odin, by Thor! Use your brain!!!
You will have to implement a lot of classes. This can seem tedious,
unless you're able to script your favorite text editor.
You are given a certain amount of freedom to complete the exercises.
However, follow the mandatory rules and don't be lazy. You would
miss a lot of useful information! Do not hesitate to read about
theoretical concepts.

Chapter I I I
Mo dule-sp eciÀùc rules
It is mandatory to use the standard containers to p erform each exercise in this mo dule.
Once a container is used you cannot use it for the rest of the mo dule.
It is advisable to read the subject in its entirety before doing the
exercises.
You must use at least one container for each exercise with the
exception of exercise 02 which requires the use of two containers.
You must submit a
Makefile
for each program which will compile your source Àùles
to the required output with the Àõags
-Wall
,
-Wextra
and
-Werror
.
You must use c++, and your MakeÀùle must not relink.
Your
Makefile
must at least contain the rules
$(NAME)
,
all
,
clean
,
fclean
and
re
.

Chapter IV
Exercise 00: Bitcoin Exchange
Exercise : 00
Bitcoin Exchange
Turn-in directory :
ex
00
=
Files to turn in :
Makefile, main.cpp, BitcoinExchange.{cpp, hpp}
Forbidden functions :
None
You have to create a program which outputs the value of a certain amount of bitcoin
on a certain date.
This program must use a database in csv format which will represent bitcoin price
over time. This database is provided with this sub ject.
The program will take as input a second database, storing the diÀôerent prices/dates
to evaluate.
Your program must resp ect these rules:

The program name is btc.

Your program must take a Àùle as argument.

Each line in this Àùle must use the following format: "date | value".

A valid date will always b e in the following format: Year-Month-Day.

A valid value must b e either a Àõoat or a p ositive integer, b etween 0 and 1000.
You must use at least one container in your code to validate this
exercise. You should handle possible errors with an appropriate
error message.

C++ - Mo dule 09 STL
Here is an example of an input.txt Àùle:
$> head input.txt
date | value
2011-01-03 | 3
2011-01-03 | 2
2011-01-03 | 1
2011-01-03 | 1.2
2011-01-09 | 1
2012-01-11 | -1
2001-42-42
2012-01-11 | 1
2012-01-11 | 2147483648
$>
Your program will use the value in your input Àùle.
Your program should display on the standard output the result of the value multiplied
by the exchange rate according to the date indicated in your database.
If the date used in the input does not exist in your DB then you
must use the closest date contained in your DB. Be careful to use the
lower date and not the upper one.
The following is an example of the program's use.
$> ./btc
Error: could not open file.
$> ./btc input.txt
2011-01-03 => 3 = 0.9
2011-01-03 => 2 = 0.6
2011-01-03 => 1 = 0.3
2011-01-03 => 1.2 = 0.36
2011-01-09 => 1 = 0.32
Error: not a positive number.
Error: bad input => 2001-42-42
2012-01-11 => 1 = 7.1
Error: too large a number.
$>
Warning: The container(s) you use to validate this exercise will no
longer be usable for the rest of this module.

Chapter V
Exercise 01: Reverse Polish Notation
Exercise : 01
RPN
Turn-in directory :
ex
01
=
Files to turn in :
Makefile, main.cpp, RPN.{cpp, hpp}
Forbidden functions :
None
You must create a program with these constraints:

The program name is RPN.

Your program must take an inverted Polish mathematical expression as an argu-
ment.

The numb ers used in this op eration and passed as arguments will always b e less
than 10. The calculation itself but also the result do not take into account this rule.

Your program must pro cess this expression and output the correct result on the
standard output.

If an error o ccurs during the execution of the program an error message should b e
displayed on the standard output.

Your program must b e able to handle op erations with these tokens: "+ - / *".
You must use at least one container in your code to validate this
exercise.

C++ - Mo dule 09 STL
You don't need to manage the brackets or decimal numbers.
Here is an example of a standard use:
$> ./RPN "8 9 * 9 - 9 - 9 - 4 - 1 +"
42
$> ./RPN "7 7 * 7 -"
42
$> ./RPN "1 2 * 2 / 2 * 2 4 - +"
0
$> ./RPN "(1 + 1)"
Error

Warning: The container(s) you used in the previous exercise are
forbidden here. The container(s) you used to validate this exercise
will not be usable for the rest of this module.

Chapter VI
Exercise 02: PmergeMe
Exercise : 02
PmergeMe
Turn-in directory :
ex
02
=
Files to turn in :
Makefile, main.cpp, PmergeMe.{cpp, hpp}
Forbidden functions :
None
You must create a program with these constraints:

The name of the program is PmergeMe.

Your program must b e able to use a p ositive integer s equence as argument.

Your program must use the merge-insert sort algorithm to sort the p ositive integer
sequence.
To clarify, yes, you need to use the Ford-Johnson algorithm.

If an error o ccurs during program execution, an error message should b e displayed
on the standard output.
You must use at least two different containers in your code to
validate this exercise. Your program must be able to handle at
least 3000 different integers.

C++ - Mo dule 09 STL
It is strongly advised to implement your algorithm for each container
and thus to avoid using a generic function.
Here are some additional guidelines on the information you should display line by line
on the standard output:

On the Àùrst line you must display an explicit text followed by the unsorted p ositive
integer sequence.

On the second line you must display an explicit text followed by the sorted p ositive
integer sequence.

On the third line you must display an explicit text indicating the time used by
your algorithm by sp ecifying the Àùrst container used to sort the p ositive integer
sequence.

On the last line you must display an explicit text indicating the time used by
your algorithm by sp ecifying the second container used to sort the p ositive integer
sequence.
The format for the display of the time used to carry out your sorting
is free but the precision chosen must allow to clearly see the
difference between the two containers used.
Here is an
example
of a standard use:
$> ./PmergeMe 3 5 9 7 4
Before: 3 5 9 7 4
After: 3 4 5 7 9
Time to process a range of 5 elements with std::[..] : 0.00031 us
Time to process a range of 5 elements with std::[..] : 0.00014 us
$> ./PmergeMe
`
shuf -i 1-100000 -n 3000 | tr "\n" " "
`
Before: 141 79 526 321 [...]
After: 79 141 321 526 [...]
Time to process a range of 3000 elements with std::[..] : 62.14389 us
Time to process a range of 3000 elements with std::[..] : 69.27212 us
$> ./PmergeMe "-1" "2"
Error
$> # For OSX USER:
$> ./PmergeMe
`
jot -r 3000 1 100000 | tr
'
\n
' ' '`
[...]
$>
The indication of the time is deliberately strange in this example.
Of course you have to indicate the time used to perform all your
operations, both the sorting part and the data management part.

Chapter VI I
Submission and p eer-evaluation
Turn in your assignment in your
Git
rep ository as usual. Only the work inside your
rep ository will b e evaluated during the defense. Don't hesitate to double check the
names of your folders and Àùles to ensure they are correct.
