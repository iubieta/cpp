Chapter I
Intro duction
C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an ex-
tension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes" (source:
 Wikipedia
).
The goal of these mo dules is to intro duce you to
Ob ject-Oriented Programming
.
This will b e the starting p oint of your C++ journey. Many languages are recommended
to learn OOP. We decided to cho ose C++ since it's derived from your old friend C.
Because this is a complex language, and in order to keep things simple, your co de will
comply with the C++98 standard.
We are aware mo dern C++ is way diÀôerent in a lot of asp ects. So if you want to
b ecome a proÀùcient C++ develop er, it's up to you to go further after the 42 Common
Core!

Chapter I I
General rules
Compiling

Compile your co de with
c++
and the Àõags
-Wall -Wextra -Werror

Your co de should still compile if you add the Àõag
-std=c++98
Formatting and naming conventions

The exercise directories will b e named this way:
ex00, ex01, ... , exn

Name your Àùles, classes, functions, memb er functions and attributes as required in
the guidelines.

Write class names in
Upp erCamelCase
format. Files containing clas s co de will
always b e named according to the class name. For instance:
ClassName.hpp
/
ClassName.h
,
ClassName.cpp
, or
ClassName.tpp
. Then, if you
have a header Àùle containing the deÀùnition of a class "BrickWall" standing for a
brick wall, its name will b e
BrickWall.hpp
.

Unless sp eciÀùed otherwise, every output messages must b e ended by a new-line
character and displayed to the standard output.

Goodbye Norminette!
No co ding style is enforced in the C++ mo dules. You can
follow your favorite one. But keep in mind that a co de your p eer-evaluators can't
understand is a co de they can't grade. Do your b est to write a clean and readable
co de.
Allowe d/Forbidden
You are not co ding in C anymore. Time to C++! Therefore:

You are allowed to use almost everything from the standard library. Thus, instead
of sticking to what you already know, it would b e smart to use as much as p ossible
the C++-ish versions of the C functions you are used to.

However, you can't use any other external library. It means C++11 (and derived
forms) and
Boost
libraries are forbidden. The following functions are forbidden
to o:
*printf()
,
*alloc()
and
free()
. If you use them, your grade will b e 0 and
that's it.


Note that unless explicitly stated otherwise, the
using namespace <ns_name>
and
friend
keywords are forbidden. Otherwise, your grade will b e -42.

You are allowed to use the STL in the Mo dule 08 and 09 only.
That means:
no
Containers
(vector/list/map/and so forth) and no
Algorithms
(anything that
requires to include the
<algorithm>
header) until then. Otherwise, your grade will
b e -42.
A few design requirements

Memory leakage o ccurs in C++ to o. When you allo cate memory (by using the
new
keyword), you must avoid
memory leaks
.

From Mo dule 02 to Mo dule 09, your classes must b e designed in the
Ortho dox
Canonical Form, except when explicitely stated othe rwise
.

Any function implementation put in a header Àùle (except for function templates)
means 0 to the exercise.

You should b e able to use each of your headers indep endently from others. Thus,
they must include all the dep endencies they need. However, you must avoid the
problem of double inclusion by adding
include guards
. Otherwise, your grade will
b e 0.
Read me

You can add some additional Àùles if you need to (i.e., to split your co de). As these
assignments are not veriÀùed by a program, feel free to do so as long as you turn in
the mandatory Àùles.

Sometimes, the guidelines of an exercise lo ok short but the examples can show
requirements that are not explicitly written in the instructions.

Read each mo dule completely b efore starting! Really, do it.

By Odin, by Thor! Use your brain!!!
You will have to implement a lot of classes. This can seem tedious,
unless you're able to script your favorite text editor.
You are given a certain amount of freedom to complete the exercises.
However, follow the mandatory rules and don't be lazy. You would
miss a lot of useful information! Do not hesitate to read about
theoretical concepts.

Chapter I I I
Mo dule-sp eciÀùc rules
You will notice that, in this mo dule, the exercises can b e solved WITHOUT the standard
Containers and WITHOUT the standard Algorithms.
However,
using them is precis ely the goal of this Mo dule
. You are allowed to
use the STL. Yes, you can use the
Containers
(vector/list/map/and so forth) and the
Algorithms
(deÀùned in header
<algorithm>
). Moreover, you should use them as much
as you can. Thus, do your b est to apply them wherever it's appropriate.
You will get a very bad grade if you don't, even if your co de works as exp ected. Please
don't b e lazy.
You can deÀùne your templates in the header Àùles as usual. Or, if you want to, you
can write your template declarations in the header Àùles and write their implementations
in .tpp Àùles. In any case, the header Àùles are mandatory while the .tpp Àùles are optional.

Chapter IV
Exercise 00: Easy Àùnd
Exercise : 00
Easy Àù nd
Turn-in directory :
ex
00
=
Files to turn in :
Makefile, main.cpp, easyfind.{h, hpp}
and optional file: easyfind.tpp
Forbidden functions :
None
A Àùrst easy exercise is the way to start oÀô on the right fo ot.
Write a function template
easyfind
that accepts a typ e
T
. It takes two parameters.
The Àùrst one has typ e
T
and the second one is an integer.
Assuming
T
is a container
of intege rs
, this function has to Àùnd the Àùrst o ccurrence
of the second parameter in the Àùrst parameter.
If no o ccurrence is found, you can either throw an exception or return an error value
of your choice. If you need some inspiration, analyze how standard containers b ehave.
Of course, implement and turn in your own tests to ensure everything works as ex-
p ected.
You don't have to handle associative containers.

Chapter V
Exercise 01: Span
Exercise : 01
Span
Turn-in directory :
ex
01
=
Files to turn in :
Makefile, main.cpp, Span.{h, hpp}, Span.cpp
Forbidden functions :
None
Develop a
Span
class that can store a maximum of
N
integers.
N
is an unsigned int
variable and will b e the only parameter passed to the constructor.
This class will have a memb er function called
addNumber()
to add a single numb er
to the Span. It will b e used in order to Àùll it. Any attempt to add a new element if there
are already
N
elements stored should throw an exception.
Next, implement two memb er functions:
shortestSpan()
and
longestSpan()
They will resp ectively Àùnd out the shortest span or the longest span (or distance, if
you prefer) b etween all the numb ers stored, and return it. If there are no numb ers stored,
or only one, no span can b e found. Thus, throw an exception.
Of course, you will write your own tests and they will b e way more thorough than the
ones b elow. Test your Span at least with a minimum of 10 000 numb ers. More would b e
even b etter.

Running this co de:
int
main

{

 sp
 =
 Span
(
5
);
sp
.
addNumber
(
6
);
sp
.
addNumber
(

);
sp
.
addNumber
(
17
);
sp
.
addNumber
(
9
);
sp
.
addNumber
(
11
);
std
::
cout
 <<
 sp

shortestSpan

 <<
 std
::
endl
;
std
::
cout
 <<
 sp
.
longestSpan
()
 <<
 std
::
endl
;
return
0
;
}
Should output:
$> ./ex01
2
14
$>
Last but not least, it would b e wonderful to Àùll your Span using a
range of iterators
.
Making thousands calls to
addNumber()
is so annoying. Implement a memb er function
to add many numb ers to your Span in one call.
If you don't have a clue, study the Containers. Some member
functions take a range of iterators in order to add a sequence of
elements to the container.

Chapter VI
Exercise 02: Mutated ab omination
Exercise : 02
Mutated ab omination
Turn-in directory :
ex
02
=
Files to turn in :
Makefile, main.cpp, MutantStack.{h, hpp}
and optional file: MutantStack.tpp
Forbidden functions :
None
Now, time to move on more serious things. Let's develop something weird.
The
std::stack
container is very nice. Unfortunately, it is one of the only STL Con-
tainers that is NOT iterable. That's to o bad.
But why would we accept this? Esp ecially if we can take the lib erty of butchering the
original stack to create missing features.
To repair this injustice, you have to make the
std::stack
container iterable.
Write a
MutantStack
class. It will
b e implemented in terms of
a
std::stack
.
It will oÀôer all its memb er functions, plus an additional feature:
iterators
.
Of course, you will write and turn in your own tests to ensure everything works as
exp ected.

Find a test example b elow.
int
main
()
{
MutantStack
<
int
>
 mstack
;
mstack
.
push
(
5
);
mstack
.
push
(
17
);
std
::
cout
 <<
 mstack
.
top
()
 <<
 std
::
endl
;
mstack
.
pop
();
std
::
cout
 <<
 mstack
.
size
()
 <<
 std
::
endl
;
mstack
.
push
(
3
);
mstack
.
push
(
5
);
mstack
.
push
(
737
);
//[...]
mstack
.
push
(
0
);
MutantStack
<
int
>::
iterator
 it
 =
 mstack
.
begin
();
MutantStack
<
int
>::
iterator
 ite
 =
 mstack
.
end
();
++
it
;
--
it
;
while
(
it
 !=
 ite
)
{
std
::
cout
 <<
 *
it
 <<
 std
::
endl
;
++
it
;
}
std
::
stack
<
int
>
 s
(
mstack
);
return
0
;
}
If you run it a Àùrst time with your MutantStack, and a second time replacing the
MutantStack with, for example, a
std::list
, the two outputs should b e the same. Of
course, when testing another container, up date the co de b elow with the corresp onding
memb er functions (
push()
can b ecome
push_back()
).

Chapter VI I
Submission and p eer-evaluation
Turn in your assignment in your
Git
rep ository as usual. Only the work inside your
rep ository will b e evaluated during the defense. Don't hesitate to double check the
names of your folders and Àùles to ensure they are correct.
